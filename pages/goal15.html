        <h1>Goal 15: Life on Land</h1>
        <p>Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, manage forests sustainably, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Life on Land Important?</h2>
            <p>Healthy ecosystems are vital for supporting life on Earth. Forests, deserts, mountains, and other land ecosystems provide essential services, such as food, water, and clean air, as well as maintaining biodiversity. However, deforestation, land degradation, and habitat loss are threatening the stability of these ecosystems. Ensuring the protection of life on land is essential for the planetâ€™s ecological balance and for human well-being.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Forests cover about 30% of the Earth's surface, providing habitat for over 80% of terrestrial species.</li>
                <li>Nearly 25% of the Earth's land area is degraded, and desertification threatens many areas globally.</li>
                <li>Over one million species are at risk of extinction due to habitat destruction, illegal wildlife trade, and climate change.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Promote reforestation and sustainable forest management practices to restore degraded lands and protect biodiversity.</li>
                <li>Support sustainable agricultural practices that conserve soil and water resources, and reduce the negative impact of farming on ecosystems.</li>
                <li>Combat illegal logging, poaching, and wildlife trafficking through strengthened law enforcement and conservation efforts.</li>
                <li>Reduce the loss of biodiversity by creating and maintaining protected areas for endangered species and critical ecosystems.</li>
                <li>Encourage policies that promote the conservation and restoration of ecosystems and the sustainable use of land resources.</li>
            </ul>
