        <h1>Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h1>
        <p>Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why are Sustainable Cities and Communities Important?</h2>
            <p>Cities and communities are the heart of global development. However, rapid urbanization, climate change, and increasing inequalities pose significant challenges to sustainable urban development. Sustainable cities and communities are essential to improving living standards, reducing environmental impact, and promoting social inclusion for all residents.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>More than 55% of the worldâ€™s population lives in cities, and this number is expected to rise to 68% by 2050.</li>
                <li>Over 1 billion people live in slums or informal settlements with limited access to basic services such as clean water and sanitation.</li>
                <li>Urban areas are responsible for 70% of global carbon emissions, making them crucial in the fight against climate change.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Promote affordable, accessible, and sustainable housing and basic services for all, including water, sanitation, and energy.</li>
                <li>Improve public transportation and mobility in urban areas, reducing pollution and congestion.</li>
                <li>Encourage the development of green spaces and promote environmental sustainability in urban planning.</li>
                <li>Support inclusive and participatory urban governance, ensuring that all members of society have a voice in decision-making.</li>
                <li>Ensure resilience to natural disasters and climate change by adopting sustainable building practices and disaster-risk reduction strategies.</li>
