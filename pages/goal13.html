        <h1>Goal 13: Climate Action</h1>
        <p>Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Climate Action Important?</h2>
            <p>Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise threaten ecosystems, food security, and livelihoods. Taking urgent climate action is essential to mitigate the impacts of climate change, reduce carbon emissions, and create a more resilient and sustainable future for all.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The global average temperature has already risen by 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels, and the world is on track to exceed 1.5°C of warming by 2030.</li>
                <li>Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.</li>
                <li>Greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from human activities like burning fossil fuels, are the main cause of global warming.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.</li>
                <li>Promote energy efficiency across all sectors, including transportation, industry, and housing.</li>
                <li>Support reforestation and sustainable land-use practices to absorb carbon and protect ecosystems.</li>
                <li>Encourage international cooperation to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and mobilize financial resources for climate action.</li>
                <li>Raise awareness about the impacts of climate change and advocate for policies that reduce emissions and promote climate resilience.</li>
