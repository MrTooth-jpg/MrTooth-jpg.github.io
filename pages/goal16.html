        <h1>Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</h1>
        <p>Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions Important?</h2>
            <p>Peace, justice, and strong institutions are fundamental to ensuring sustainable development. Societies that are peaceful, fair, and just provide the foundation for economic growth, social cohesion, and environmental protection. Without peace and strong governance, development progress can be easily disrupted, leading to conflict, instability, and inequality.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Nearly 1.5 billion people live in countries affected by conflict and fragility.</li>
                <li>Corruption, bribery, and illicit financial flows hinder social and economic progress and undermine trust in institutions.</li>
                <li>Access to justice is crucial for ensuring that all people, especially the vulnerable, are protected by the rule of law and have their rights upheld.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Strengthen the rule of law by ensuring justice systems are impartial, efficient, and accessible to all people, regardless of their background.</li>
                <li>Promote transparency and accountability in government and institutions to reduce corruption and enhance public trust.</li>
                <li>Support peaceful conflict resolution mechanisms, including mediation and dialogue, to address the root causes of violence.</li>
                <li>Ensure the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and safeguard the rights of minorities and vulnerable groups.</li>
                <li>Foster strong institutions by promoting democratic participation, effective governance, and policies that encourage inclusivity and equity.</li>
