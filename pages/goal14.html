        <h1>Goal 14: Life Below Water</h1>
        <p>Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Life Below Water Important?</h2>
            <p>The oceans and seas are essential to the health of the planet. They regulate climate, support biodiversity, and provide livelihoods for millions of people. However, overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction threaten the balance of marine ecosystems. Protecting life below water is crucial for maintaining a sustainable and resilient environment.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and are home to a diverse range of species.</li>
                <li>Over 80% of marine pollution comes from land-based activities, such as plastic waste, sewage, and industrial runoff.</li>
                <li>Overfishing has led to a significant decline in fish stocks, affecting marine ecosystems and coastal communities.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce plastic waste and other pollutants entering the oceans by improving waste management and recycling systems.</li>
                <li>Promote sustainable fishing practices to protect marine biodiversity and ensure the long-term health of fish populations.</li>
                <li>Establish marine protected areas to safeguard vulnerable ecosystems and support the recovery of endangered species.</li>
                <li>Combat ocean acidification by reducing carbon emissions and implementing measures to protect coral reefs and marine life.</li>
                <li>Encourage international cooperation and policy-making to preserve and restore marine resources for future generations.</li>
