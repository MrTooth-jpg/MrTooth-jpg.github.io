        <h1>Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy</h1>
        <p>Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Affordable and Clean Energy Important?</h2>
            <p>Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity in the world today. Achieving affordable and clean energy for all is critical for reducing poverty, improving health, and promoting economic growth. It also plays a key role in combating climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Nearly 1 billion people worldwide still lack access to electricity.</li>
                <li>About 2.8 billion people rely on inefficient and polluting cooking systems, including open fires and traditional stoves.</li>
                <li>Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, accounted for approximately 26% of global energy consumption in 2018.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase investment in renewable energy projects, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, especially in developing countries.</li>
                <li>Improve energy efficiency in industries, homes, and transportation systems.</li>
                <li>Ensure affordable and clean cooking solutions are available to all, particularly in low-income and rural areas.</li>
                <li>Strengthen international cooperation to facilitate the transfer of clean energy technologies.</li>
                <li>Implement policies that promote the use of renewable energy and energy-efficient solutions at the local, national, and global levels.</li>
            </ul>
