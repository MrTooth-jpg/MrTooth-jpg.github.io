        <h1>Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</h1>
        <p>Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure Important?</h2>
            <p>Infrastructure, industrialization, and innovation are crucial for economic growth and development. They help create jobs, reduce inequality, and drive progress in areas such as healthcare, education, and the environment. By fostering sustainable and resilient infrastructure, we can support inclusive growth and reduce the environmental impact of industrialization.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Almost 1 billion people live without access to electricity, limiting their ability to improve their standard of living.</li>
                <li>About 60% of global emissions come from industry, making sustainable industrialization essential in tackling climate change.</li>
                <li>There is a significant gap in infrastructure investment, especially in developing countries, which impacts overall economic growth.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Promote investments in infrastructure, including renewable energy, sustainable transportation, and internet connectivity.</li>
                <li>Encourage innovation by supporting research and development, particularly in sustainable technologies and industries.</li>
                <li>Foster small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and ensure that they have access to necessary infrastructure and technology to grow.</li>
                <li>Improve the sustainability of industries by adopting cleaner, more efficient technologies and production methods.</li>
                <li>Enhance international cooperation and partnerships to improve infrastructure and share knowledge in industrial development and innovation.</li>
            </ul>
