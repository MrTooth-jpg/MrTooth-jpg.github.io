        <h1>Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</h1>
        <p>Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Decent Work and Economic Growth Important?</h2>
            <p>Decent work and economic growth are essential for building a strong economy, reducing poverty, and ensuring a better quality of life. This goal focuses on creating conditions where people can access productive and meaningful employment, fair wages, and a safe working environment, contributing to the prosperity of both individuals and society.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Globally, 71 million young people are unemployed, and many more are underemployed or working in informal jobs.</li>
                <li>Nearly 1.3 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day, without access to basic services.</li>
                <li>The global economy is growing slower than necessary to achieve full employment and decent work for all.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Promote policies that encourage entrepreneurship, particularly among youth and marginalized groups.</li>
                <li>Increase investments in infrastructure, including green and sustainable industries, to create jobs.</li>
                <li>Ensure that all workers have access to fair wages, safe working conditions, and social protection.</li>
                <li>Support the transition to a more sustainable and circular economy that reduces environmental impact while creating quality jobs.</li>
                <li>Foster skills development and lifelong learning to help workers adapt to changes in the labor market and technology.</li>
