        <h1>Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</h1>
        <p>Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Responsible Consumption and Production Important?</h2>
            <p>Overconsumption and unsustainable production methods are driving environmental degradation, resource depletion, and pollution. Transitioning to sustainable consumption and production is essential to protect the planet and ensure that resources are available for future generations. It involves reducing waste, using resources efficiently, and promoting sustainable business practices.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Approximately one-third of the food produced globally is wasted, contributing to hunger and environmental harm.</li>
                <li>The global material footprint of consumption and production has increased dramatically, putting immense pressure on ecosystems and natural resources.</li>
                <li>The industrial sector is responsible for about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, largely due to inefficient production processes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Promote sustainable and ethical production practices, ensuring companies reduce their environmental impact and waste.</li>
                <li>Encourage consumers to make responsible choices by promoting sustainable products and reducing consumption of single-use goods.</li>
                <li>Improve waste management systems and increase recycling rates to minimize landfill use and resource loss.</li>
                <li>Support innovation in technologies that enable resource-efficient production and reduce carbon emissions.</li>
                <li>Encourage policies and frameworks that incentivize sustainability across industries, from agriculture to manufacturing.</li>
            </ul>
