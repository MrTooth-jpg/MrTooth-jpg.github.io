        <h1>Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities</h1>
        <p>Reduce inequality within and among countries by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Reduced Inequality Important?</h2>
            <p>Inequality within and between countries is one of the greatest challenges for sustainable development. Reducing inequality is essential for promoting social justice, improving access to resources, and ensuring that no one is left behind in the pursuit of progress. Addressing inequalities helps to create peaceful and inclusive societies where everyone can thrive.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The richest 1% of the global population hold more than 40% of the wealth, while the poorest 50% own only 1%.</li>
                <li>Globally, women still earn less than men for the same work, and disparities in access to education and healthcare persist.</li>
                <li>Income inequality is rising in many countries, with marginalized groups and communities being disproportionately affected.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or income, in access to education, healthcare, and employment.</li>
                <li>Promote policies that reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation, social protection, and inclusive economic policies.</li>
                <li>Support the empowerment of marginalized communities and encourage their participation in decision-making processes.</li>
                <li>Address discrimination and social exclusion by challenging harmful practices and promoting inclusive societal norms.</li>
                <li>Strengthen international cooperation to reduce inequalities between countries, especially in terms of economic development, trade, and technology.</li>
            </ul>
