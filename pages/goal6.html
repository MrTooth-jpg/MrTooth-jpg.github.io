        <h1>Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</h1>
        <p>Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Why is Clean Water and Sanitation Important?</h2>
            <p>Access to clean water and sanitation is essential for human health and well-being. It is necessary for the survival of all life, human and animal, and is crucial for reducing diseases, improving hygiene, and ensuring the overall sustainable development of communities and countries.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Nearly 2.2 billion people around the world lack access to safely managed drinking water services.</li>
                <li>Over 4.2 billion people do not have access to safely managed sanitation.</li>
                <li>Water scarcity affects more than 40% of the global population, and this number is expected to increase with climate change.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How Can We Achieve This Goal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials.</li>
                <li>Increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and implement integrated water resources management at all levels.</li>
                <li>Invest in modern, efficient, and sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure, particularly in rural and underserved areas.</li>
                <li>Encourage water conservation and sustainable practices in communities, businesses, and industries.</li>
                <li>Ensure equitable access to water and sanitation, particularly for marginalized and vulnerable populations.</li>
            </ul>
